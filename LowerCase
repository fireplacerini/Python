##            (1) Ask User if they like Python                 ##
##            (2) Convert answer to uppercase and lowercase    ##
##            (3) Check to see if the answer is "yes" or "no"  ##
##            (4) If the answer is neither the user is asked   ##
##                to re-enter until they get it right          ##

##       This script contains 2 Functions:                     ##
##            (1) askuser() - Asks for answer from User        ##
##            (2) Caseconv() - Takes answer from user and      ##
##                converts it to uppercase and lowercase.  It  ##
##                also checks to see if answer is yes or no    ##

##  This is the first function that asks user the question and 
##  returns the value

## This is the second function that takes the answer and converts
## it to uppercase and lowercase
def Caseconv():
       upyanswer = pyanswer.upper()
       lowerr = pyanswer.lower()
##  If the lowerr case answer is yes or no, it sets

##  in 1 array.
       return upyanswer,lowerr,answerr

##  while statement will continue to prompt the user

##  Once the correct answer is received, the next 2 statements
##  will extract the lower- and upper- case values from
##  the Caseconv function.  Lower- is the 1st value and Upper
##  is the 2nd value.
